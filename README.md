# SpaceWarGame
 I developed the SpaceWarGame-2D using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am using various images in png formats such as alien, plane, space and fire. For the Sounds effects, used audio files such as fireex.wav, collion.wav and gameover.wav. This is the link to my SpaceWarGame-2D just go to the link and try it.
